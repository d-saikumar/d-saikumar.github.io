### Neural Style Transfer using TensorFlow

Neural Style Transfer with TensorFlow is a Python script leveraging the VGG19 model for artistic image transformation. This technique combines the content of one image with the style of another, creating visually striking results.

### Revolutionizing Data Analysis: Unleashing the Power of Automation with OpenAI GPT-3

This code highlights the exciting concept of automating data analysis. By combining the OpenAI GPT-3 language model with Python's Pandas library, it streamlines the entire data analysis process. It sets up the API key, reads data, formulates a request for analysis, and then lets GPT-3 generate detailed insights automatically. This automation empowers data scientists and analysts to quickly derive valuable information from their datasets, and also allows analysts to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their work.

### Aggression Detection with Multinomial Naive Bayes

Text classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes for aggression detection. The code preprocesses and classifies text as 'Overtly Aggressive,' 'Covertly Aggressive,' or 'Non-aggressive.' It employs feature selection and cross-validation for model tuning, with an interactive input option to test custom text. A practical solution for automated aggression identification in social media and text data.

### OptiSheet-Plywood-Cutter 

I developed a Python-based optimization tool to significantly reduce plywood wastage for a local business in Hindupur town of Andhra Pradesh, leading to cost savings and environmental benefits. This reduced 30-40% of the wastage in plywood cutting. 
Users simply input main sheet and part sizes, and receive a cutting layout image for optimal material use.

Input:

Output Layout:

<img src="images/OptiSheet_Output.png?raw=true" />

This tool has the potential to:

1) Reduce plywood wastage, leading to substantial cost savings for the business.

2) Minimize environmental impact by conserving natural resources.

3) Enhance productivity and efficiency in the cutting process.

4) This solution can be adapted for similar optimization challenges in other industries.
