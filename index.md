### Aggression Detection with Multinomial Naive Bayes

Text classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes for aggression detection. The code preprocesses and classifies text as 'Overtly Aggressive,' 'Covertly Aggressive,' or 'Non-aggressive.' It employs feature selection and cross-validation for model tuning, with an interactive input option to test custom text. A practical solution for automated aggression identification in social media and text data.
